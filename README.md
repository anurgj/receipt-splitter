# Receipt Splitter v1.3

A simple Streamlit app that parses **Walmart** PDF receipts and helps split item costs among friends (supports both equal and percentage-based splits, per item). It also handles ignoring items and shows parity checks against the receipt total.

## Features

- ðŸ“„ **PDF parsing** using PyMuPDF (`fitz`) to extract items, subtotal, taxes, and total  
- ðŸ‘¥ **Flexible splitting**: select people per item, equal share or custom percentages  
- ðŸ™ˆ **Ignore items** you donâ€™t want included in the split  
- ðŸ§® **Rounding-aware** fair split (uses `Decimal`)  
- âœ… **Sanity check**: compares calculated total vs. adjusted receipt total

## Demo (TL;DR)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
